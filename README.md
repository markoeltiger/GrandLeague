## About The Project

![Screen Shot](https://xd.adobe.com/view/1fff6bf0-bfa0-48aa-9a84-5ce56317ae74-4aac/screen/e601e8e5-0286-489c-b6e4-3e1c0491682d/specs/)

I build the app to be offline first which loads data from API the inserts it in room database then the view fetches it from the database so the user will always see data which gives better user exprince

Here's how:

* Send request with retrofit to api to get data
* Insert the Fetched data to the Database
* Let the UI fetch the data from Room Database 
* Now user always happy because the app always had data:smile:

 
A list of commonly used resources that I find helpful are listed in the acknowledgements.
